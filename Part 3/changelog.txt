--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Added array filled with punctuation to be ignored in the file
2. Added function that uses the punctuation array to remove punctuation
   from the file as it is being parsed
3. Common words are no longer removed from the file as it is being parsed.
4. Instead, every calculated n-gram is searched for common words. If there
   are common words in the gram, then the whole gram is ignored. Otherwise,
   the gram is stored as normal. 
5. Removed unused remove punctuation function.
